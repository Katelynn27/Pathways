                Hi! I'm Katelynn Blank and I'm currently finishing my degree in Microelectronic Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Inspired by a beloved mentor who passed away this year, I've founded the Pathways to Possibilities Foundation to empower women and underprivileged youth in STEM. My own journey navigating the challenges of being a woman in STEM has driven me to create opportunities for others. At the Pathways to Possibilities Foundation, we're dedicated to fostering a supportive community where everyone can explore, learn, and thrive in STEM fields.
