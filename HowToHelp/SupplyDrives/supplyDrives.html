    <h1>How to Run a Successful Supply Drive</h1>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>1. Plan Your Drive</h2>
        <p>Before you start, it's important to define what you hope to achieve with your supply drive. Determine which schools or communities will benefit, what supplies are most needed, and how much you aim to collect.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">

        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Reach out to local schools to get a specific list of needed supplies. This ensures that your efforts are aligned with their actual needs.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>2. Build Your Team</h2>
        <p>Gather a group of volunteers who are passionate about helping students. This can include friends, family, coworkers, or members of local community organizations. Assign roles such as marketing, collection logistics, and coordination with schools.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">

        <div class="tip">Tip: Having a diverse team with different skills can make the process smoother and more efficient.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>3. Set a Timeline</h2>
        <p>Establish a clear timeline for your supply drive. Decide on start and end dates, and create a schedule for key activities such as marketing, collection, and distribution.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">

        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Running the drive a few weeks before the school year starts can ensure supplies are delivered in time for the first day of school.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>4. Choose Collection Points</h2>
        <p>Identify convenient locations where people can drop off donations. Consider partnering with local businesses, community centers, libraries, and churches to serve as collection points.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">

        <div class="tip">Tip: Ensure collection points are well-publicized and easy to access. Provide clear signage and instructions at each location.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>5. Promote Your Drive</h2>
        <p>Create a marketing plan to spread the word about your supply drive. Use social media, local newspapers, community bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth to reach a broad audience. Create eye-catching flyers and posters to distribute around town.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Use social media to post updates and share success stories. Encourage people to take photos of their donations and use a specific hashtag to increase visibility.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>6. Collect and Sort Donations</h2>
        <p>As donations start coming in, regularly collect supplies from your drop-off locations. Sort the items to ensure they are in good condition and organize them by type (e.g., notebooks, pencils, backpacks).</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            [Photo: Volunteers sorting donations]
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Enlist volunteers to help with sorting and packing supplies. Make it a fun event with music and refreshments to keep spirits high.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>7. Distribute the Supplies</h2>
        <p>Coordinate with the schools or organizations you're supporting to arrange the delivery of the supplies. Ensure you have a reliable method of transportation and a plan for distributing the items to students.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
            [Photo: Handing over supplies to a community organization]
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Consider hosting a distribution event where families can come to pick up supplies. This can create a sense of community and ensure the supplies get directly to those in need.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>8. Thank Your Supporters</h2>
        <p>After the drive is complete, take the time to thank everyone who contributed. Send thank-you notes, post acknowledgments on social media, and consider organizing a small appreciation event for your volunteers.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">

        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Share the impact of the drive with your supporters. Photos, stories from students, and feedback from schools can show how their contributions made a difference.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>9. Evaluate and Report</h2>
        <p>Assess the success of your drive. Share results with your community and supporters.</p>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Use the insights gained to improve future drives and maintain donor engagement.</div>
