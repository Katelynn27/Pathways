    <h1>How to Run a Successful Supply Drive</h1>
    <div class="photo-placeholder">
    </div>
    <div class="step">
        <h2>1. Plan Your Drive</h2>
        <p>Before you start, it's important to define what you hope to achieve with your supply drive. Figure out which schools or communities will benefit, what supplies they need the most, and how much you plan to collect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Reach out to local schools to get a specific list of needed supplies. If you're still in contact with former teachers of yours, check in with them and see what they may need.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>2. Build Your Team</h2>
        <p>Get a group of volunteers or friends who want to help students! You can also include family members, coworkers, or members of local organizations. You can assign roles, giving different people different responsibilities, like marketing or communicating with schools.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>3. Set a Timeline</h2>
        <p>Give your group a clear timeline for the supply drive. Set start and end dates, and create a plan for how your group will get there. You can think of it as a roadmap of sorts, include things like postering, social media posts, volunteer recruitment, collection dates, distributions dates, etc.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Running the drive a few weeks before the semester starts can ensure supplies are delivered in time for the first day of classes.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>4. Choose Collection Points</h2>
        <p>Make your collection points convenient locations where people can drop off donations. Consider partnering with local businesses, community centers, libraries, and churches to serve as collection points. Most importantly, get written permission beforehand for any spots you choose to use.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Ensure collection points are well-publicized and easy to access. Provide clear signage and instructions at each location.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>5. Promote Your Drive</h2>
        <p>Use social media, local newspapers, community bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth to reach a broad audience. Create eye-catching flyers and posters to hang around your area!.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Sites like Canva can be very useful when making flyers and social media posts for an event like this.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>6. Collect and Sort Donations</h2>
        <p>As donations start coming in, regularly collect supplies from your drop-off locations. Make sure to sort the items to ensure they are in good condition and organize them by type (e.g., notebooks, pencils, backpacks).</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>7. Distribute the Supplies</h2>
        <p>Coordinate with the schools or organizations you're supporting to arrange a time to give them the supplies. Make sure you have a reliable method of transportation and a plan for how you want to distribute the items, would you like to distribute them to the community yourself or turn them directly over to a school or teacher(s).</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
        <h2>8. Thank Your Supporters</h2>
        <p>After the drive is complete, take the time to thank the people who contributed to making the event a success. You can send thank-you notes, post acknowledgments on social media, and maybe hold a small appreciation event for your volunteers.</p>
        <div class="photo-placeholder">
        </div>
        <div class="tip">Tip: Share the impact of the drive with your supporters. Photos and feedback from schools can show how their contributions have made a difference for students.</div>
